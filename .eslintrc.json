/*
 * We are disabling the @next/next/no-img-element rule because we are using
 * the <img> tag for now instead of the <Image> component from Next.js.
 * This is acceptable for the current phase of development where image optimization
 * is not a priority, and we want more control or simplicity over the image rendering.
 * In the future, we may consider migrating to the <Image> component for performance optimizations.
